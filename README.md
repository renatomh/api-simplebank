# API Simple Bank

## üí° Project's Idea

This project was developed while studying Go, Docker and Kubernetes. It aims to create a simple bank API.

## üîç Features

* Create new accounts with different currencies;
* Transfer money from your accounts to another ones;
* Refresh tokens;

## üõ† Technologies

During the development of this project, the following techologies were used:

- [Go](https://go.dev/)
- [Gin Web Framework](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
- [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper)
- [gomock](https://github.com/golang/mock)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [golang-migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/tree/master/cmd/migrate)
- [sqlc](https://sqlc.dev/)
- [gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux)

## üíª Project Configuration

### First, you must install these tools:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) for Windows or [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for Mac
- [migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/tree/master/cmd/migrate)
- [choco](https://chocolatey.org/install) and [choco install make](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2532234/how-to-run-a-makefile-in-windows) for Windows
- [sqlc](https://docs.sqlc.dev/en/stable/overview/install.html) (for WIndows, we'll use it on a Docker image)

### Setting up infrastructure:

Starting postgres container, creating database and running database migration up all versions:

```bash
$ make postgres
$ make createdb
$ make migrateup
```

## üåê Setting up config files

**Important Observation**: the files which will be copied to the Docker image being built must have the End of Line (EOL) sequence as 'LF' (Line Feed). If it's set to 'CRLF' (Carriage Return + Line Feed), it might cause some errors like "*exec /app/start.sh: no such file or directory*" or "*error: parse "postgresql://root:secret@localhost:5432/simple_bank?sslmode=disable\r": net/url: invalid control character in URL*".

At least, these files should have the EOL set as 'LF':
- [app.env](app.env)
- [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml)
- [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)
- [Makefile](Makefile)
- [start.sh](start.sh)
- [wait-for.sh](wait-for.sh)

In order to build docker images from a Dockerfile, we can do it with the following command (if we already have a *Dockerfile* on the directory where the command is being executed):

```bash
$ docker build -t simplebank:latest .
```

We can create docker networks with the following command:

```bash
$ docker network create bank-network
```

To setup images from the [docker-compose](docker-compose.yaml), first we need to update the [app.env](app.env) file setting the apropriated 'DB_SOURCE' host (e.g.: changing the '*@localhost*' part of the string to '*@postgres*'). Then, we can use the command:

```bash
$ docker compose up
```

If new database migrations need to be created, the following command can be used (you must replace *<migration_name>* with the actual description for the migration):

```bash
$ migrate create -ext sql -dir db/migration -seq <migration_name>
```

## ‚èØÔ∏è Running

To run the application locally, you can use the following command:

```bash
$ make server
```

## Documentation

To create the database docs, we're using [dbdocs.io](https://dbdocs.io/), you need Node and NPM installed, in order to install it on your machine. To install it, run the following command:

```bash
$ npm install -g dbdocs
```

Then, login to dbdocs with the command below:

```bash
$ dbdocs login
```

And now you can build the documentation providing the docs .dbml file for it, like seen in the example below (adjust the path for your .dbml file). The URL for the documentation will be displayed after the build is complete.

```bash
$ dbdocs build doc/db.dbml
```

You can also protect the documentation page setting a password for it. The following command achieves this (update *\<password\>* with your actual password):

```bash
$ dbdocs password --set <password> --project simple_bank
```

We can also use a tool to generate SQL schema from .dmbl files. First, we install the tool via:

```bash
$ npm install -g @dbml/cli
```

Then, we use the command below to output the schema file (updating the output and input file paths):

```bash
$ dbml2sql --postgres -o doc/schema.sql doc/db.dbml
```
